/**
Channel-wide event broadcaster and subscriber

This can be cloned and stored elsewhere in an application in order to
send events to connected channel clients. Retrieve a [`ChannelBroadcaster`] from a
[`Channel`](crate::Channel) by calling
[`Channel::broadcaster`](crate::Channel::broadcaster)

ChannelBroadcaster also implements [`Stream`] so that your application
can listen in on ChannelEvents happening elsewhere. This might be used
for spawning a task to log events, or synchronizing events between
servers.
