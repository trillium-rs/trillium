/**
This open (pub fields) struct represents a http upgrade. It contains
all of the data available on a Conn, as well as owning the underlying
transport.

Important implementation note: When reading directly from the
transport, ensure that you read from `buffer` first if there are bytes
in it. Alternatively, read directly from the Upgrade, as that
[`AsyncRead`] implementation will drain the buffer first before
reading from the transport.
